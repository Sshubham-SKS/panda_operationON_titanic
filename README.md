 # panda_operationON_titanic 

  

Overview 
This Jupyter Notebook is designed to perform data analysis on the Titanic dataset using the pandas library. The primary goal is to manipulate, clean, and explore the dataset by performing various operations such as column selection, data insertion, and data visualization. 

  

Features 
Data Loading and Display: Load and display the Titanic dataset using pandas. 
Column Selection: Extract specific columns from the dataset (e.g., Ticket numbers, Passenger names). 
New Column Insertion: Add new columns to the dataset (e.g., Food, new_col). 
Data Summary: Visualize summaries of different columns, such as Passenger IDs, Names, and Tickets. 

  

Requirements 
Python 3.6+ 
Jupyter Notebook 
pandas 1.3+ 
numpy (optional for additional analysis) 

  

Usage 
Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook. 
Run each cell to process the Titanic dataset. 
Modify cells or add new ones to perform custom data analysis on the dataset. 

  

Future Work 
Further exploration and cleaning of the data. 
Advanced visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms). 
Integration with machine learning models for predictive analysis.
